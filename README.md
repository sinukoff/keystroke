# keystroke
This program predicts whether two samples of text were typed by the same user by comparing keystroke patterns. Users are distinguished by their rates of movement between different zones of the keyboard displayed in the figure below. Samples from different users are distinguished with better than 80% accuracy while samples from the same user are correctly identified with ~90% success.
